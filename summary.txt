I adjusted the numberCheckers to 5 for the 1st run and the average wait time was 4.02 minutes with total idle time of 23 minutes. 
Then I adjusted the numberCheckers to 100 for the 2nd run and the average wait time was 1.75 minutes with total idle time of 
1648 minutes.Finally I adjusted it to 90 for the 3rd run and the average wait time was 1.70 minutes with total idle time of 16051
minutes.The results suggest that as the idle time for checkers increases dramatically (from 23 to 1648 to 16051 minutes), the 
average customer wait time actually decreases (from 4.02 to 1.75 to 1.70 minutes).The simulation helps demonstrate how different
staffing configurations might impact both customer experience and operational efficiency in a retail environment.
